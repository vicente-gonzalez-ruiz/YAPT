    "An [exception](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html) is an event which occurs during the execution of a program and that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When a Python code generates an exception, it must either handle the exception immediately or [*raises*](https://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/python/web/raise-statement.html) it. Otherwise execution terminates.\n",
