    "Concurrency is the action of running several tasks at the time (concurrently). Notice that concurrency does not means [paralelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing) (only one task can be running while the rest wait).\n",

    "A [thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)) is a sequence of instructions that periodically are executed, typically, in concurrency (and somethimes, depending on the computing context, in parallel) with other threads [of the same process space](https://pymotw.com/3/threading/index.html#module-threading). However, you must know that [CPU-bound tasks are not a good fit for Python threads, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Parallel computations in Python should be done in multiple processes, not threads.](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/12/27/python-threads-communication-and-stopping) As a consequence of this problem, at this moment, it is impossible to use more than one [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) using Python Threads in [CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython), exclusively.\n",
